# Repo for HGD's project MODS 45: Janet'sources

Those are sources and assets for the game. They represent a dump of the project's Assets directory.

After importing the content in a nez unity project, you will need to:
   - create a layer 3 called Player
   - create a layer 6 called Enemies
   - create a layer 7 called Evil
   - In the Project Settings (Edit), go to Physics 2D and disable collision between the layers Player and Enemies, and the layers Enemies and Evil.
